Android Tic-Tac-Toe Game



An Android application implementing a simple Tic-Tac-Toe (X and O) game. The app consists of two activities:



&nbsp;	Main Activity: allows players to enter their names and start the game, with error messages shown via Toast if fields are left empty.



&nbsp;	Game Activity: displays the 3Ã—3 game board using buttons and a TextView for game state messages (whose turn it is, winner or draw).



Additional features include disabling further moves once the game is finished, and a toolbar action to change the background color using a color picker dialog.
